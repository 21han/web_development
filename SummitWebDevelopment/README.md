### Product Design
The design of the web app is to make sure users can easly scroll down the page to retrieve information they need with the least 
amount of efforts. We achieve this by combining a one page style for the conference page and various dynmaic and user friendly 
features such as embedded Youtube link, Google map, Google form and circular speaker headshot display to show the information to the users. 

### Product Implementation
To achieve such design goal and to aid SEO, we are putting the most important conference related and speaker related information to
the front page of the website. In addition, small details matters. For example, using the animation for agenda window appearing
is something that will appeal to the users. In additon, using the embedded links allow people in charge of maintaince to better manage
the website without worrying about the backend too much. 

### Evaluation 
The web app successfully improves data collecting mechanism by using an external data collect design. It also effectively shows the
informaiton(time, location, date, speaker info) all in one page to ensure effective data communications. 

### Appendix
We are using a basic front page framework and style package from Bootstrap. The detail of the packages used for the web app can
be found in the files on this github.
